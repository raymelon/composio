## Overview

The Community Reward Agent is an AI Agent that rewards community members with SOL based on their engagement.

## Getting Started

<Step title='Creating Solana Transfer Action'>

<Step title="Initializing the Tools and the LLM">
```python initialize toolset and llm

<Step title="Setting up Function Calling Worker">
```python setup function calling worker

              "You also have access to Slack and can fetch conversation history and get channel id based on the channel name. You can also get username based on the user id by fetching all users in the slack team. Your job is to find out the most active community member and reward them with 1 SOL"
        ),
    )
]

agent = FunctionCallingAgentWorker(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    prefix_messages=prefix_messages,
    max_function_calls=10,
    allow_parallel_tool_calls=False,
    verbose=True,
).as_agent()
```
</Step>

<Step title="Executing the Agent">
```python run the agent
community_channel_name = input("Enter the name of the slack channel: ")
response = agent.chat(f"""Find only the most active community member this week from the slack channel {community_channel_name} and then print their slack name. The date today is {date}""")

my_wallet_address = os.getenv('SOLANA_WALLET_ADDRESS')
agent.chat(f"""send 1 SOL from my wallet {my_wallet_address}, my private key is {private_key} to {wallet_address} on devnet using send sol action and then check transaction status twice/thrice after 5 seconds of the transaction using get transaction status action.
